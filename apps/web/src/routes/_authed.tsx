/**
 * Auth layout route - pathless layout that protects all child routes.
 *
 * Checks for an authenticated better-auth session, redirects to /auth/login if not found.
 * Owns the app shell for every signed-in page that has one, so the rail and
 * header survive a move between a brand, its organization, and the admin
 * section instead of being rebuilt by whichever layout was entered. Layouts
 * declare which shell they live in through `staticData.shell`; see
 * lib/shell-scope.ts.
